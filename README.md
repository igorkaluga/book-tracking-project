This is a simple book library project.

You can add a book to your library along with: author, pages, read stutas.
After the book has been added you can delete it from your library or update it's read status.

Still currently in the works.
The main logic is complete in JS and the layout of the page is complete.
Need to finish the styling, as well as caching.
